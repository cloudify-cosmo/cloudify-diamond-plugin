Cloudify Diamond Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Diamond plugin is used to install & configure a
`Diamond <https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Diamond>`_
monitoring agent (version 3.5) on hosts.

Diamond is a python daemon
that collects system metrics and publishes them to multiple destinations.
It is capable of collecting cpu, memory, network, i/o,
load and disk metrics as well as many other metrics as specified in the
`docs <https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Diamond/wiki/Collectors>`_.
Additionally, it features an API for implementing custom collectors
for gathering metrics from almost any source.
